### Industry

I currently work as a design verification engineer at Ampere Computing. Previously, I worked at Intel, also as a design verification engineer. Due to my non-disclosure agreements, I can't mention what exactly I work/have worked on. You can see my skill set [here](/about).

### Open Source

In order of highest to lowest priority, this is what I'm working on currently:

#### [vcd_rust](https://crates.io/crates/vcd_rust)

A value change dump parser for Rust. The goal for this project is to create a parser for the VCD file type to be used in other projects. Rust was chosen due to its high performance.

Note that this project is in a very early alpha stage, and is mostly not ready for actual usage.
