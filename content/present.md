### Industry
I currently work as a design verification engineer at Intel. Due to my non-disclosure agreement, I can't mention what exactly I work on. You can see my skillset [here](/about).

### Open Source
#### [vcd_rust](google.com)
A value change dump parser for Rust. The goal for this project is to create a parser for the VCD file type to be used in other projects. Rust was chosen due to its high performance, and it's the hot new thing right now.
