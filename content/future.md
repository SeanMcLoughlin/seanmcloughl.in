### Mind Dump

This is just a mind dump of projects I plan to work on in the future. [DM me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/sean_mclough) if you're interested in working with me, or feel free to take these ideas for your own projects.

[ ] A terminal user interface waveform viewer. Inspired by [tui-rs](https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs).

[ ] A GUI waveform viewer to complement the above.

[X] EDIT: [Check out VLaDOS!](https://github.com/SeanMcLoughlin/VLaDOS) ~~A free and open-source SystemVerilog compiler. [icarus-verilog](http://iverilog.icarus.com/) doesn't support most of SystemVerilog as far as I know, and most other offerings are not free.~~

[ ] A free and open-source SystemVerilog build tool that manages dependencies (e.g. UVM). Something as simple to use as Rust's `cargo` would be nice.
