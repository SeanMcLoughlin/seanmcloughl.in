<p>VLaDOS is now defunct and its (empty) repository was removed. It had a very short life after I learned about already-existing tools to do meet its goals, such as <a href="https://github.com/fabianschuiki/llhd">LLHD</a> (and, to an extent, <a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a>). It makes far more sense to contribute to this project than to start something from scratch. I researched tools like this earlier this year and couldn&rsquo;t find <em>anything</em>, but I guess LLHD released their paper earlier this year and I missed it.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who responded on Twitter with great feedback on this subject. I&rsquo;m really glad there are a lot of people who work with HDLs who want to make the tool ecosystem better.</p>
<h2 id="original-article">Original Article</h2>
<p>Today, I&rsquo;ve finally begun work on the SystemVerilog compiler and simulator, <a href="https://github.com/SeanMcLoughlin/VLaDOS">VLaDOS</a>. This project has been a long time coming, and I&rsquo;ve had to learn a lot to even get to the point of being able to start writing it. This is probably the most ambitious project I have ever taken up, and is my first <em>major</em> open-source project. Because of that, I&rsquo;m going to do development blogs for each alpha release of the tool that has major features &ndash; starting with this one.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-vlados">What is VLaDOS?</h2>
<p>VLaDOS aims to be a free and open-source SystemVerilog compiler and simulator. The project has a few goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>Obviously, <strong>compile code that adheres to the SystemVerilog LRM into a simulator executable.</strong></li>
<li>As much as is reasonable and possible, <strong>act as a drop-in replacement for most other EDA vendor compilers and simulators.</strong> Semiconductor companies should have minimal pain switching to this tool &ndash; otherwise they may never do so.</li>
<li><strong>Remain free and open-source</strong> to allow anyone to simulate SystemVerilog anywhere.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="whats-with-the-name-vlados">What&rsquo;s with the name &ldquo;VLaDOS?&rdquo;</h2>
<p>VLaDOS is an acronym for <em>(System)Verilog Language: a Definitively Open Simulator</em>. It is also a play-on-words of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLaDOS">GLaDOS</a>, the AI antagonist of the popular <em>Portal</em> video game series.</p>
<h2 id="why-are-you-working-on-this">Why are you working on this?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve discussed this in length in my <a href="https://seanmcloughl.in/posts/modern-hardware-design/">&ldquo;Modern&rdquo; Hardware Design</a> post, but the gist of the issue is that EDA vendors generally provide sub-par tools at extreme prices per license. Not only are these licenses are a non-trivial development cost for semiconductor companies, but any individual who isn&rsquo;t able to pay for a license has no way of simulating SystemVerilog code on their local machine.</p>
<p>In this case, the only feasible option is to use <a href="https://www.edaplayground.com/">EDAPlayground</a>, but there are obvious downsides to this, namely that it requires an account, and that you have to run the code in a web browser.</p>
<p>I like software development, I work in the semiconductor industry, and I see this as a major pain point for the industry at large. Given the circumstances, I almost feel like I have an obligation to work on things such as this.</p>
<h2 id="why-rust">Why Rust?</h2>
<p>Basically all the reasons that anyone would choose Rust over C++ for an application like this. It&rsquo;s more modern. It has attractive features. Its  not tied to linking with other C++ code (aside from LLVM, which there are Rust bindings for). I can think of several more reasons off the top of my head, but you get the idea.</p>
<p>Maybe a few months down the line I&rsquo;ll realize that Rust was a terrible choice and I&rsquo;ll revert to using C++, but I highly doubt it.</p>
<h2 id="this-sounds-great-how-can-i-help">This sounds great! How can I help?</h2>
<p>Compilers are huge undertakings, and I know that I won&rsquo;t be able to complete this project by myself. If you know Rust and want to work on an interesting domain-specific language that was used to code your CPU/GPU, feel free to chat on the project&rsquo;s <a href="https://gitter.im/vlados-compiler">Gitter community</a>. Eventually, descriptive <a href="https://github.com/SeanMcLoughlin/VLaDOS/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22">issues</a> will be filed, and you should look there instead.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not able to contribute via code, a financial contribution would mean a lot. You can <a href="https://github.com/SeanMcLoughlin">sponsor me on GitHub</a>, or you can <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/smcloughlin">buy me a coffee</a>.</p>
