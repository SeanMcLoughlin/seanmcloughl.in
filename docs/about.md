I am a pre-silicon validation engineer and software developer at Intel in Portland, Oregon. I have worked in IP validation for nearly three years and have designed 
several software tools to aid in validation efficiency. I validated key components of [Intel's 11th-gen SOCs](eleventh-gen), and am currently working on more 
exciting projects at Intel.

With hardware validation, I have experience with Synopsys and Cadence EDA tools (such as VCS and Verdi), SystemVerilog, and UVM.

For software development, I have professional experience writing code in C, C++, and Python. I self-taught myself Rust as a replacement for C++, and it is probably
my most-loved language I've worked with.

I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Engineering from the University of Michigan -- Ann Arbor in 2018. Go Blue!

Outside of work I enjoy PC gaming, weight training, cooking, and reading about politics, philosophy, and the sciences.
